**<u>Project Description & Goals:</u>**

The purpose of this analysis is to explore a Zillow Real Estate dataset through visualizations and statistical tests and identify potential features that can accurately predict future tax assessed home values.


<br>



<br>

After exploring the Zillow dataset I design a machine learning (ML) model using regression techniques with the goal of predicting a home's tax assessed value with greater accuracy than that of a baseline estimate (mean).
